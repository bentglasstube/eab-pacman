Eatabrick Arch Package Repository

Here you can find x86_64 packages for software I wrote and its dependencies.
These packages are all signed with my GPG key which is available from
keyservers with id 94FD72A0. Please email me with any issues.

Instructions

First you will need to fetch and sign my public GPG key

      # pacman-key -r 94FD72A0
      # pacman-key --lsign-key 94FD72A0


Then you will need to add the following to pacman.conf:

      [eatbrick]
      SigLevel = Required
      Server = http://repo.eatabrick.org/$arch


Note that I only maintain packages for x86_64 at this time

Now you should be all set to install whatever packages I am maintaining (after
syncing pacman of course).
